# Introduction to deep learning
Introduction to Deep Learning with theory and full coding examples.
### Part 1 - Linear Perceptron
* Inspiration - The Biological Neuron Model
* Perceptron - An Artificial Neural Network
* Decision Units - Activation functions
* Learning - the Bias and weights
* Perpetron Example - Logic OR
### Part 2 - Non Linear Perceptron
* Why deep learning ?
* Non Linear Activation function
* Handwritten Digit Classification (Mnist )
### Part 3 - Multiple Layer Neural Networks
* How to train Multiple Layer Neural Networks
* Gradient Decent - Minimize loss function iterativly
* Delta rule for learning
* Backpropagation
* Train ,predict and evaluate MLP for Logic OR - example
### Part 4 - Keras Mnist example
* Load and normalize data set
* Create the model
* Train the model
* Evaluate Model
* Predict
